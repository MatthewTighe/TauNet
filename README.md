## Matthew Tighe's CS300 TauNet project
To run TauNet, simply enter the command python followed by either client.py or server.py in a Raspbian terminal while located in the TauNet directory. Both can be run simultaneously but must be run in separate terminal windows. 
TauNet is meant to be run with a .csv file which includes usernames and
in 3-30 seven-bit ASCII characters of letters, digits, or dashes as well as
a matching dynamic dns address value.
